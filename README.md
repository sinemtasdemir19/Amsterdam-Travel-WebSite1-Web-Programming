# Amsterdam Travel Web Site (Web Programming)
# WEB SITE NAME: BON VOYAGE
# TOPIC: TRAVEL SITE
## What is our purpose?
We wanted to make a site that guides people who want to go to Amsterdam to complete their 
work before starting the journey and to do activities during their trip.
Bon Voyage means have a good journey. Like the name of our page, we aimed to ensure that 
our users can get information about the city before they go and make their plans according to the 
city by seeing the places to visit so that they can have a good trip. If they want to start the 
process to go and do not know where to start, they will find their answers on our site.
Before we created this site, during our conversations with people around us, we realized that 
people needed a travel guide in the countries or cities they went to. It is not correct to limit this 
as only places to visit. What attracts people to go to that country or city is sometimes its history 
and culture, sometimes its atmosphere, and sometimes its natural beauties. This site will be a 
complete guide for them.
## Who are our users and what are their characteristic features ?
People of all ages who want to visit can use this site easily. There are no physical limitations.
The characteristic features of our users are primarily that they are curious to travel. People who 
love to do research and acquire new information will enjoy our site very much. But this does not 
mean that it is suitable only for users who want to learn about a particular topic. It has an easyto-use design for people of all ages to use.
## What are the users' works?
This site, which we designed responsive, was made through HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Our 
menu icon that appears when our site page, which is organized according to gather requirements, 
is minimized, and all other used icons are commonly used icons. Because people know the 
purpose and use of these icons and the feedback they use, they become eligible for visibility and 
affordance and feedback requirements. That's why we use gather requirements for our site.

### FOR FIRST PAGE
First of all, our logo on every page welcomes the users.
Since the purpose of our first page is to create a simple and understandable home page, we have 
created a simple navbar with a sidebar consisting of pictures that draw the user in.
We made sure that this page was responsive. Thus, If the user is browsing our site from large 
screens, our menu can be seen in full at the top. but people entering from small screens encounter 
the menu icon. so by clicking on the icon they display our menu.
The first thing that draws attention when you enter our site is actually the slide bar. The user can 
control the slide bar made with Bootstrap in 2 ways. The first method is to move forward with 
the next and prev buttons on the sides. The second method is to display the photos in the desired 
sequence with the buttons under the slide bar.
We have finished our introduction page with the footer section under the slide bar.
### FOR SECOND PAGE
Our on this page is to inform the user about the city. Users who want to go to Amsterdam while 
learning new things about its history can easily handle their hotel booking, visa and ticket 
transactions on our page.
When you open the page, a banner that appears under the navbar welcomes you. Thus, we focus 
the user's focus on the subject and the page a little more.
When you scroll down the page a little bit, the time and weather conditions of Amsterdam greet 
you. Thus, people who are planning to go to Amsterdam can arrange themselves.
Then, thanks to the sliding boxes we have created, you are greeted with a brief summary of the 
second page. The floating boxes actually act like a menu that sends you to the relevant sections 
of the page.
The contents in it are the history of Amsterdam, natural beauties, ticket and visa procedures.
The map at the end of the page gives the location of Amsterdam.
### FOR THIRD PAGE
When you open our third page, we welcome you again with our box menu. Since there may be 
users who do not understand the usage at first glance, you can navigate to the page you want 
with hover effects when you hover over the boxes. The purpose of this page is more to adopt and 
gain knowledge of Amsterdam culturally. The contents you can access are museums, restaurants, 
popular places, movies, music and vlogs.
As a result of the information obtained in the restaurants section, we direct the user to the 
necessary sites so that he can reserve the restaurant he likes.
In the popular places section, the user can see the location of the places and make their plans.
In the movies section, the user can access information about the movie and its IMDB score with 
the hover effect that appears when hovering over the posters of the movies, and they are directed 
to the required page for more information.
The music section has recommendations for users who are more interested in the culture of 
Amsterdam.
The vlog part is a good alternative for users who want to feel like they are in Amsterdam while 
having fun.
This page also responsive.
### FOR FOURTH PAGE
Our fourth and last page, the contact us page, we have created so that users can write their 
requests and complaints in general and reach us.
